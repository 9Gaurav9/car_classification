# Fine-Grained Car Model Classification

## Overview

This project focuses on classifying car images into specific makes, models, and years using deep learning techniques. The system is built with PyTorch and involves a custom model architecture for accurate classification.

## Project Structure

- **`car_classification/`**: Contains the core functionality of the project.
  - **`model.py`**: Defines the model architecture.
  - **`data.py`**: Handles data loading and preprocessing.
  - **`train.py`**: Script for training the model.
  - **`predict.py`**: Script for evaluating the model on test data.
- **`check.py`**: A utility script for checking the setup and dependencies.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car_classification.git
   cd car_classification
Create and Activate Virtual Environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv myenv
myenv\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download and Prepare Data:

Place your car dataset in a directory and update the train_dir and test_dir paths in the predict.py and train.py files.
Usage
Training the Model
To train the model, run:

bash
Copy code
python train.py
Evaluating the Model
To evaluate the model's performance, run:

bash
Copy code
python predict.py
Checking the Setup
To check the setup and dependencies, run:

bash
Copy code
python check.py
Model Architecture
The model architecture is defined in car_classification/model.py. The specific architecture used for classification is abstracted within this module. Update the file if needed to define or modify the model.
Project Goals
Develop a robust model to classify car images into specific makes, models, and years.
Implement efficient data handling and preprocessing techniques.
Achieve high classification accuracy on test data.
